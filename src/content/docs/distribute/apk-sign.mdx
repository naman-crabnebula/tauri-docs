To publish on the Play Store, you need to sign your app with a digital certificate.

Android uses two signing keys: upload and app signing.

Developers upload an `.aab` or `.apk` file signed with an upload key to the Play Store.
The end-users download the `.apk` file signed with an app signing key.
To create your app signing key, use Play App Signing as described in the [official Play Store documentation](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9842756?hl=en&visit_id=638549803861403647-3347771264&rd=1).

To sign your app, use the following instructions.

<Steps>
1. Create an `upload` Keystore

    If you have an existing keystore, skip to the next step. If not, create one using one of the following methods:

    1.  Following the [Android Studio key generation steps](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#sign-apk)
    2.  Running the following at the command line:
        On Mac/Linux, use the following command:

        ```
        keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
        ```

        On Windows, use the following command:

        ```
        keytool -genkey -v -keystore $env:USERPROFILE\upload-keystore.jks -storetype JKS -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
        ```

        This command stores the `upload-keystore.jks` file in your home directory. If you want to store it elsewhere, change the argument you pass to the `-keystore` parameter. However, keep the `keystore` file private; don't check it into public source control!

        :::note

        - The `keytool` command might not be in your pathâ€”it's part of Java, which is installed as part of Android Studio. You may find it installed in the JDK that is installed with Android Studio, for example:

            - Linux: `/opt/android-studio/jbr/bin/keytool`
            - macOS: `/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home/bin/keytool`
            - Windows: `C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\jbr\\bin\\keytool.exe`

            Then use that fully qualified path. If your path includes space-separated names, such as Program Files, use platform-appropriate notation for the names. For example, on Mac/Linux use `Program\ Files`, and on Windows use `"Program Files"`.

        - The `-storetype JKS` tag is only required for Java 9 or newer. As of the Java 9 release, the keystore type defaults to PKS12.
        :::

3.  Reference the Keystore from the App

    Create a file named `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/keystore.properties` that contains a reference to your keystore:

    ```
    storePassword=<password from previous step>
    keyPassword=<password from previous step>
    keyAlias=upload
    storeFile=<location of the key store file, such as /Users/<user name>/upload-keystore.jks or C:\\Users\\<user name>\\upload-keystore.jks>
    ```

    :::caution
    Keep the `keystore.properties` file private; don't check it into public source control.
    :::

4.  Configure Signing in Gradle

    Configure gradle to use your upload key when building your app in release mode by editing the `[project]/src-tauri/gen/android/app/build.gradle.kts` file.

    1.  Add the needed imports at the beginning of the file:

        ```kotlin
        import java.util.Properties
        import java.io.FileInputStream
        ```

    2.  Add the `release` signing config before the `buildTypes` block:

        ```kotlin {3-12}
        signingConfigs {
            create("release") {
                val keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file("keystore.properties")
                val keystoreProperties = Properties()
                if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
                    keystoreProperties.load(FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
                }

                keyAlias = keystoreProperties["keyAlias"] as String
                keyPassword = keystoreProperties["keyPassword"] as String
                storeFile = file(keystoreProperties["storeFile"] as String)
                storePassword = keystoreProperties["storePassword"] as String
            }
        }

        buildTypes {
            ...
        }
        ```

    3.  Use the new `release` signing config in the `release` config in `buildTypes` block:

        ```kotlin {3}
        buildTypes {
            getByName("release") {
                signingConfig = signingConfigs.getByName("release")
            }
        }
        ```

</Steps>

Release builds of your app will now be signed automatically.
