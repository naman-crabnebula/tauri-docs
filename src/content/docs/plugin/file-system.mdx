Access the file system.

## Supported Platforms

- Windows
- Linux
- macOS

## Setup

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.75**_

Install the fs plugin to get started.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Automatic" >

    	Use your project's package manager to add the dependency:

    	{ ' ' }

    	<CommandTabs
            npm="npm run tauri add fs"
            yarn="yarn run tauri add fs"
            pnpm="pnpm tauri add fs"
            bun="bun tauri add fs"
            cargo="cargo tauri add fs"
    	/>

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Manual">
    	<Steps>

    	1.	Install the fs plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

    		```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml"
    		[dependencies]
    		tauri-plugin-fs = "2.0.0-beta"
    		# alternatively with Git:
    		tauri-plugin-fs = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
    		```

    	2.	Modify `lib.rs` to initialize the plugin:

    		```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" ins={4}
    		#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
    		fn run() {
    			tauri::Builder::default()
    				.plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())
    				.run(tauri::generate_context!())
    				.expect("error while running tauri application");
    		}
    		```

    	3.	Install the JavaScript Guest bindings using your preferred JavaScript package manager:

    		<CommandTabs
                npm = "npm install @tauri-apps/plugin-fs"
                yarn = "yarn add @tauri-apps/plugin-fs"
                pnpm = "pnpm add @tauri-apps/plugin-fs"
                bun = "bun add @tauri-apps/plugin-fs"
    		/>

    	</Steps>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Usage

The fs plugin is available in both JavaScript and Rust.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript" >

```javascript
import { exists, BaseDirectory } from '@tauri-apps/plugin-fs';
// when using `"withGlobalTauri": true`, you may use
// const { exists, BaseDirectory } = window.__TAURI_PLUGIN_FS__;

// Check if the `$APPDATA/avatar.png` file exists
await exists('avatar.png', { baseDir: BaseDirectory.AppData });
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label = "Rust" >

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs"
use tauri_plugin_fs::FsExt;

#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]
fn run() {
  tauri::Builder::default()
      .plugin(tauri_plugin_fs::init())
      .setup(|app| {
          // allowed the given directory
          let scope = app.fs_scope();
        	scope.allow_directory("/path/to/directory", false);
          dbg!(scope.allowed());

          Ok(())
       })
       .run(tauri::generate_context!())
       .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Security

This module prevents path traversal, not allowing absolute paths or parent dir components (i.e. `/usr/path/to/file` or `../path/to/file` paths are not allowed). Paths accessed with this API must be relative to one of the base directories so if you need access to arbitrary file system paths, you must write such logic on the core layer instead.

See [@tauri-apps/plugin-fs - Security](/reference/javascript/fs/#security) for more information.

## Permissions

By default all plugin commands are blocked and cannot be accessed. You must define a list of permissions in your `capabilities` configuration.

See [Permissions Overview](/security/permissions/) for more information.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/main.json" ins={7-11}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "fs:default",
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-exists",
      "allow": [{ "path": "$APPDATA/*" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Default Permissions

This configuration file defines the default permissions granted to the filesystem.

#### Granted Permissions

This default permission set enables all read-related commands and allows access to the `$APP` folder and sub directories created in it. The location of the `$APP` folder depends on the operating system, where the application is run.

In general the `$APP` folder needs to be manually created by the application at runtime, before accessing files or folders in it is possible.

#### Denied Permissions

This default permission set prevents access to critical components of the Tauri application by default. On Windows the webview data folder access is denied.

| Permission        | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fs:default`      |                                                                              |
| `fs:deny-default` | This denies access to dangerous Tauri relevant files and folders by default. |

### Scope Permissions

| Permission                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Scopes

To allow any `fs` command to access specific scopes:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/main.json" {7-10}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    {
      "identifier": "fs:scope",
      "allow": [{ "path": "$APPDATA" }, { "path": "$APPDATA/**" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

To allow specific `fs` command to access specific scopes:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/main.json" {7-14}
{
  "$schema": "../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-rename",
      "allow": [{ "path": "$HOME/**" }]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "fs:allow-exists",
      "allow": [{ "path": "$APPDATA/*" }]
    }
