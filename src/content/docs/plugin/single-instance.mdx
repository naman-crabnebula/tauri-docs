Ensure that a single instance of your tauri app is running at a time using the Single Instance Plugin.

## Setup

Install the Single Instance plugin to get started.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Automatic">

    Use your project's package manager to add the dependency:

    <CommandTabs npm="npm run tauri add single-instance"
    yarn="yarn run tauri add single-instance"
    pnpm="pnpm tauri add single-instance"
    bun="bun tauri add single-instance"
    cargo="cargo tauri add single-instance" />

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Manual">
    <Steps>
    <ol>
      <li>
        **Install :** Add the plugin to the project's dependencies in `Cargo.toml`.
      <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="crates.io">
      ```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml" ins={2}
      [dependencies]
      tauri-plugin-single-instance = "2.0.0-beta"
      ```
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Git">

      ```toml title="src-tauri/Cargo.toml" ins={2}
      [dependencies]
      tauri-plugin-single-instance = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
      ```
        </TabItem>
      </Tabs>
      </li>
      <li>
        **Initialize :** Update `lib.rs` (or `main.rs` for desktop-only apps) to initialize the plugin:

      ```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" ins={3}
      pub fn run() {
          tauri::Builder::default()
              .plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {}))
              .run(tauri::generate_context!())
              .expect("error while running tauri application");
      }
      ```
      </li>
    </ol>
    </Steps>
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Usage

The plugin is already installed and initialized, and it should be functioning correctly right away. Nevertheless, we can also enhance its functionality with the `init()` method.

The plugin `init()` method takes a closure that is invoked when a new app instance was started, but closed by the plugin.
The closure has three arguments:

  <Steps>

1. **`app` :** The [AppHandle](https://docs.rs/tauri/latest/tauri/struct.AppHandle.html) of the application.
2. **`args` :** The list of arguments, that was passed by the user to initiate this new instance.
3. **`cwd` :** The Current Working Directory denotes the directory from which the new application instance was launched.

  </Steps>

So, the closure should look like below

```rust
.plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {
  // Write your code here...
}))
```

### Focusing on New Instance

By default, when you initiate a new instance while the application is already running, no action is taken. To focus the window of the running instance when user tries to open a new instance, alter the callback closure as follows:

```rust title="src-tauri/src/lib.rs" {1} {5-7} {12-21}
use tauri::{AppHandle, Manager};

pub fn run() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_single_instance::init(|app, args, cwd| {
            let _ = show_window(app);
        }))
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}

fn show_window(app: &AppHandle) {
    let windows = app.webview_windows();

    windows
        .values()
        .next()
        .expect("Sorry, no window found")
        .set_focus()
        .expect("Can't Bring Window to Focus");
}
```
